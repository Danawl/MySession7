            <p> Hello, I'm Daniel Awil, dedicated to learning and trying to be updated with the latest trends in the industry. I am excited 
                about the possibilities that web development offers, and I'm ready to explore and contribute to this ever-evolving field.</p>
    
            <p> When I'm not coding, you can find me doing my hobbies such as playing videogame, playing sports, or just
                watching a series and movies in my free time. I also love  exploring new technologies and experimenting 
                with different coding techniques to improvemy skills. I'm excited about the endless possibilities 
                that the world of web development offers, and I'm always open to new challenges and opportunities.</p>
